<h2>Advantages of Lamda</h2>

1. Fewer Lines of Code
2. Sequential and Parallel Execution Support by passing behavior in methods
3. Higher Efficiency (Utilizing Multicore CPUâ€™s)

<h2>Functional programming <h2>


you could think about lambda expressions as a way of supporting functional programming in Java. Functional programming is a paradigm that allows programming using expressions i.e. declaring functions, passing functions as arguments and using functions as statements (rightly called expressions in Java8). If you want to learn more about why it is called Lambda expressions, you could try to understand what Lambda Calculus is.


An Overview of OOP vs. Functional Programming
For more than a decade, OOP languages featured almost every need of the programmer and would continue to do so in many years to come, no doubt. However, there are certain situations where functional programming seems to provide a better construct of the solution.

In OOP, everything is represented as an object; therefore, every solution to a problem must be defined as a scheme of classes and their properties even if we need only to implement the behaviour. This type of situation is the niche for functional programming, where we define only the behaviour through functions and not objects. This means in functional programming we directly implement a function rather than an class that contains a function. This is the basic difference between OOP and functional programming.


Method Reference :

Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface. It is compact and easy form of lambda expression. Each time when you are using lambda expression to just referring a method, you can replace your lambda expression with method reference.
